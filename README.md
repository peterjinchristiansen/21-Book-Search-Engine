## Installation

If on the github repo, to install your dependencies you will be using the following command:

    npm install

---




## Usage

The app was supposed to run on: https://vast-brushlands-83091.herokuapp.com/

However, I do not have enough time before my deadline to finish troubleshooting my deployment issues.

All functionalities of the app should run smoothly with use of the following commands:

    npm install => installs all necessary dependencies in the root, server, and client folders

    npm start => runs both the frontend and backend of the application

server will run on PORT 4000
client will run on PORT 3000
